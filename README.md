# CASTAWAY NL

Despite Dutch trains being among the worldwide leaders in punctuality, 
the worst nightmare of any commuter in the Netherlands 
is to find this screen in a train station. 
Rijdt Niet literally means that the trains are not driving. 
Chaos reigns upon the station, 
workers get barraged with questions about when the problem will be solved, 
or are appealed to offer alternatives to reach the ultimate goal: 
get to the destination as fast as possible.
And all this drama because of train malfunctions.
