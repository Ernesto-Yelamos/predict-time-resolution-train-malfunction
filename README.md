# CASTAWAY NL

Despite Dutch trains being among the worldwide leaders in punctuality, the worst nightmare of any commuter in the Netherlands is to find a Rijdt Niet screen in a train station. Rijdt Niet literally means that the trains are not driving. Chaos reigns upon the station, workers get barraged with questions about when the problem will be solved, or are pressured to offer alternatives to reach the ultimate goal: get to the destination as fast as possible. And all this drama because of train malfunctions.

NS is the principal passenger railway operator in the Netherlands, with an average of 1 million passengers per day and a gradual increase in passenger km every year. 2020 will obviously be an outlier once the year is over, but the tendency is for train usage in the Netherlands to continue rising.

I have used a train malfunction dataset from NS, spanning the year 2019, and I have combined it with climate data from the same year to predict how long it will take for a train malfunction to be resolved, and to help train users make more confident decisions against a Rijdt Niet screen. Sometimes it might be best to just stay put than to take 4 bus combinations to get home.
