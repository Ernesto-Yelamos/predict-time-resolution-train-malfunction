I have used a train malfunction dataset from NS (the principal passenger railway operator in the Netherlands) spanning the year 2019, and I have combined it with climate data from the same year to predict how long it will take for a train malfunction to be resolved and to help train users make more confident decisions against train delays or cancellations.
